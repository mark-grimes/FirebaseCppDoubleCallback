# Directory of the C++ dependencies

These dependencies are not kept in the repository. You need to download [Firebase C++ SDK v7.1.1](https://dl.google.com/firebase/sdk/cpp/firebase_cpp_sdk_7.1.1.zip) and place in this directory (or sym link to it). The directory in here should be called `firebase_cpp_sdk_7_1_1`.
